# Release Notes - 2.2.0
## Features

1.	Added PrivateNetworking switch to enable creating the host VM without public IP address. To use this feature, the subnet must already exist and the deployment must be initiated from a machine that has access to that subnet. To deploy, pass the following additional parameters to deployer: `--PrivateNetworking true --VnetResourceGroupName <existing virtual network resource group name> --VnetName <existing VNET name> --SubnetName <existing subnet name, optional if the VNET contains single subnet>` ([#160](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/160)).

## Bug fixes and enhancements

1.	Added support for using existing Batch and Storage accounts when deploying a new CoA instance. To use, pass --BatchAccountName and --StorageAccountName to the deployer. The accounts must exist in the same region as the CoA instance and the user running the deployer must be able to assign roles to those accounts ([#159](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/159), [#150](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/150)).
2.	Enforcing HTTPS for the default storage account on new deployments. If using an existing storage account, this setting will not be modified ([#158](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/158)).
3.	Deprecated the public msgenpublicdata/inputs storage container. If upgrading, the container will get commented out in the containers-to-mount file ([#175](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/175)).
4.	Fixed the issue where upgrade from 1.x to 2.1+ failed due to missing /data/cromwellazure directory ([#186](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/186)).
5.	Fixed creation time corruption issue ([#170](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/170)).
6.	Now using SI units for disk/file/memory sizes ([#167](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/167)).
7.	Improved logging and metrics ([#171](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/171), [#169](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/169), [#82](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/82)).
8.	Fixed decompression failures for input processing ([#180](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/180)).
9.	Upgraded CosmosDB client to v3 ([#89](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/89)).
10. Fixed the issue where deployer could get stuck on "Waiting for Cromwell to perform one-time database preparation..." ([#189](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/issues/189)).

## Update instructions

You can update any previous CoA deployment to 2.2.0:
1.  Follow instructions to [run the deployment executable](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure#run-the-deployment-executable), and for arguments, specify `--Update true --SubscriptionId abc123 --ResourceGroupName mycoa --VmPassword password` with the correct values for your existing CoA deployment. If you don't remember the password for the `vmadmin` user, you can reset it via the Azure Portal or Azure CLI.  Example:<br/>
 
`.\deploy-cromwell-on-azure.exe --Update true --SubscriptionId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --ResourceGroupName mycoa --VmPassword password`
